# Rails API Template

### Status: WIP

### Purpose: for API's and for teaching my students who want to create SPA's.

### What's Included:

* ActiveModel serializer gem which should work great if you plan to use Ember.js

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/katgironpe/rails_api_template.git myapi
$ rm -r myapi/.git && rm myapi/README.md
```
